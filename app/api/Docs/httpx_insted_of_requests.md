**`httpx`** is often preferred over the **`requests`** library in modern Python web projects for several reasons, particularly when dealing with more advanced or async-based use cases. Below are the key reasons for using `httpx`:

### 1. **Asynchronous Support**
- **`httpx`** natively supports **asynchronous** requests using Python's `asyncio` framework, whereas **`requests`** is a synchronous library.
- When building modern APIs, especially with frameworks like **FastAPI** (which is designed around async principles), it's crucial to have an HTTP client that supports asynchronous communication to avoid blocking the event loop.
- With `httpx`, you can write:
  ```python
  import httpx

  async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
      response = await client.get('https://example.com')
  ```
  This allows the HTTP request to run without blocking the entire application, making it ideal for high-performance APIs.

### 2. **HTTP/2 Support**
- **`httpx`** provides support for **HTTP/2**, which can offer better performance in certain scenarios compared to HTTP/1.1, such as improved connection reuse and parallel request multiplexing.
- The **`requests`** library, in contrast, only supports HTTP/1.1 without direct support for HTTP/2.

### 3. **Timeouts and Retries**
- **`httpx`** has more flexible and configurable **timeouts** and **retries** compared to `requests`, making it easier to handle network issues in production environments.
- For example, you can easily set read, connect, and write timeouts independently, giving more control over network operations:
  ```python
  async with httpx.AsyncClient(timeout=httpx.Timeout(10.0, read=5.0, connect=2.0)) as client:
      response = await client.get('https://example.com')
  ```

### 4. **First-Class Support for Connection Pooling**
- **`httpx`** provides **connection pooling** by default, similar to `requests`, but with added features for async management.
- This can lead to improved performance in applications that need to make many HTTP requests, such as services communicating with other microservices or APIs.

### 5. **Compatibility with `requests`**
- **`httpx`** provides a synchronous API that is very similar to **`requests`**, which makes transitioning from `requests` quite straightforward for existing projects. You can simply replace `requests` with `httpx` with minor code changes if you want to adopt async features later.
- Itâ€™s effectively a drop-in replacement with a richer feature set.

### 6. **Advanced Features**
- **`httpx`** also includes advanced features like **cookie persistence**, **proxies**, **custom transports**, and **URL parsing**, similar to what `requests` offers but with additional options.
- The flexibility makes **`httpx`** better suited for projects where you need to deal with complex API integrations.

### 7. **Future-Proofing with Async APIs**
- The trend in modern Python development is moving toward **asynchronous programming**, especially in the context of web services, to handle concurrent workloads effectively.
- Using `httpx` can future-proof the application, making it easier to scale when the need for concurrent, non-blocking requests arises.

### Example Comparison

Here is a simple example that shows how similar the syntax is for both libraries, with `httpx` offering both sync and async capabilities:

#### With `requests` (Synchronous)
```python
import requests

response = requests.get('https://example.com')
print(response.text)
```

#### With `httpx` (Synchronous)
```python
import httpx

response = httpx.get('https://example.com')
print(response.text)
```

#### With `httpx` (Asynchronous)
```python
import httpx
import asyncio

async def get_example():
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.get('https://example.com')
        print(response.text)

asyncio.run(get_example())
```

### Summary
- **`httpx`** is used because it provides **asynchronous support**, which is essential for non-blocking I/O in modern web frameworks like **FastAPI**.
- It also offers **HTTP/2 support**, **more granular timeouts**, and a **richer feature set** for both sync and async usage, making it versatile for building modern microservices.
- The transition from **`requests`** to **`httpx`** is relatively easy since **`httpx`** retains a familiar API while also adding async features, making it more powerful and flexible for projects that may evolve into requiring concurrency.

These capabilities make `httpx` a more powerful and suitable choice, especially for projects that are built on asynchronous architectures or that need scalability and better performance in communication with other services.
