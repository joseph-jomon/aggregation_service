Yes, it makes sense to **clear the corresponding IDs** and their values from Redis once the combined data has been successfully sent to the database service. This will prevent redundant data from remaining in Redis and free up memory.

You can implement this by calling a Redis **`del`** operation after the data is successfully ingested.

Hereâ€™s how you can modify the **Redis service** to delete the entries after ingestion:

### 1. Modify the `ingestion_service.py` to Clear Redis After Ingestion

You can clear the relevant **Redis keys** (corresponding to the IDs) once the data has been successfully ingested.

**Updated `ingestion_service.py`**:

```python
import httpx
from app.services.redis_service import delete_keys_from_redis

async def ingest_combined_data_bulk(data_list: list):
    """
    Ingests a batch of combined data into the database using the external bulk ingestion endpoint and clears the corresponding Redis keys.

    Args:
        data_list (list): A list of combined data dictionaries including 'id', 'text_embedding', 'image_embedding', and 'index_name'.
    """
    if not data_list:
        return None  # Handle the case where the list is empty

    # Validate that all items have the same index_name
    index_names = set(data['index_name'] for data in data_list)
    if len(index_names) > 1:
        raise ValueError("All embeddings in the batch must belong to the same index.")

    # Use the common index_name from the batch
    index_name = index_names.pop()

    # Send the entire batch to the bulk ingestion endpoint
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.post(f"http://database-service:8000/ingest/{index_name}", json=data_list)

        # If the ingestion is successful, clear the corresponding Redis keys
        if response.status_code == 200:
            ids_to_clear = [data['id'] for data in data_list]
            await delete_keys_from_redis(ids_to_clear)  # Clear Redis keys
            return response.status_code, response.json()
        else:
            raise Exception(f"Failed to ingest data: {response.text}")
```

### 2. Add a Function to Delete Keys from Redis

Now, we need to add a utility function in the **Redis service** to delete the keys corresponding to the IDs.

**Add to `redis_service.py`**:

```python
async def delete_keys_from_redis(ids: list):
    """
    Deletes the keys from Redis corresponding to the given list of IDs.

    Args:
        ids (list): A list of IDs whose Redis data should be deleted.
    """
    async with redis_client.pipeline() as pipe:
        for data_id in ids:
            # Delete the hash for this ID from Redis
            pipe.delete(data_id)
        await pipe.execute()  # Execute the pipeline to delete the keys
```

### Key Points:

1. **Clear Redis After Successful Ingestion**:
   - After successfully sending the combined embeddings to the database service, the Redis keys corresponding to the IDs in that batch are deleted using `delete_keys_from_redis`.

2. **`delete_keys_from_redis` Function**:
   - This function accepts a list of **IDs** and deletes their associated Redis entries using `pipe.delete(data_id)`. A Redis pipeline is used to efficiently execute all delete commands in one network round trip.

### Summary:
- Once the data is successfully sent to the database service, the corresponding entries in Redis are cleared to prevent stale or redundant data from taking up space.
- This ensures efficient memory usage and keeps Redis clean by removing entries that have been processed and sent to the database.
