You're correct in pointing out that **batch deletes** can be more efficient than deleting items one by one. Additionally, the keys like **`image_embedding_ids`** and **`text_embedding_ids`**—which are sets used to track embeddings—need to be cleaned up as well after the corresponding embeddings are ingested and deleted from Redis. Otherwise, they will still contain IDs that no longer have corresponding embeddings stored in Redis, leading to inconsistencies.

### Let's break it down:

1. **Batch Deletion**: Instead of deleting each key one by one, you can use **Redis's `del` command** in a batch. This is much more efficient, especially when dealing with a large number of keys.

2. **Clearing Set Keys (`image_embedding_ids` and `text_embedding_ids`)**: After an ID's embeddings have been processed and deleted from Redis, the ID should also be removed from the **sets** that track which IDs have text and image embeddings ready. These set keys (`image_embedding_ids` and `text_embedding_ids`) exist to track readiness but should be cleaned after ingestion.

3. **Are the Sets (`image_embedding_ids` and `text_embedding_ids`) Necessary?**:
   - **Yes**, they serve a purpose. These sets help ensure that both text and image embeddings for an ID are available before processing. But once the embeddings have been ingested and deleted from Redis, the ID should be **removed from these sets** as well.
   - You can batch remove IDs from these sets using **`SREM`** in Redis.

### Optimized Solution: Professional Approach

Let’s update the solution to include **batch deletion** and **removal from the set keys**.

#### 1. Batch Delete Keys After Ingestion

We'll use Redis's **`del` command** in a batch to delete all the relevant keys for the embeddings in one go.

#### 2. Remove IDs from `image_embedding_ids` and `text_embedding_ids`

After successfully processing both embeddings, we can remove the corresponding **ID** from the sets that track text and image embeddings.

### Updated `delete_keys_from_redis` Function

Here’s how to handle the **batch deletion** and **clean up the tracking sets**.

```python
async def delete_keys_from_redis(ids: list):
    """
    Deletes the Redis keys corresponding to the given list of IDs and removes them from tracking sets.

    Args:
        ids (list): A list of IDs whose Redis data should be deleted.
    """
    TEXT_EMBEDDING_SET = "text_embedding_ids"
    IMAGE_EMBEDDING_SET = "image_embedding_ids"

    async with redis_client.pipeline() as pipe:
        # Batch delete the hash keys for the IDs
        pipe.delete(*ids)  # Use the splat operator (*) to pass all IDs in one go to the 'del' command

        # Remove IDs from the text and image embedding sets
        pipe.srem(TEXT_EMBEDDING_SET, *ids)  # Batch remove IDs from the text embedding set
        pipe.srem(IMAGE_EMBEDDING_SET, *ids)  # Batch remove IDs from the image embedding set

        # Execute the pipeline to perform all operations in a batch
        await pipe.execute()
```

### Key Points:
1. **Batch Deletion of Redis Keys**:
   - **`pipe.delete(*ids)`**: This deletes all keys associated with the given **IDs** in a single command, improving efficiency compared to deleting each key one by one.

2. **Remove IDs from the Sets**:
   - **`pipe.srem(TEXT_EMBEDDING_SET, *ids)`** and **`pipe.srem(IMAGE_EMBEDDING_SET, *ids)`**: These commands remove the **IDs** from the sets that track text and image embeddings, ensuring the sets remain clean after processing.

3. **Redis Pipeline**:
   - The entire operation—deleting the keys and removing the IDs from the sets—is done in a single **Redis pipeline** to minimize network round trips and improve performance.

### Updated `ingestion_service.py`

This will ensure that after successful ingestion, the corresponding keys and tracking set entries are cleaned up.

```python
import httpx
from app.services.redis_service import delete_keys_from_redis

async def ingest_combined_data_bulk(data_list: list):
    """
    Ingests a batch of combined data into the database using the external bulk ingestion endpoint and clears the corresponding Redis keys.

    Args:
        data_list (list): A list of combined data dictionaries including 'id', 'text_embedding', 'image_embedding', and 'index_name'.
    """
    if not data_list:
        return None  # Handle the case where the list is empty

    # Validate that all items have the same index_name
    index_names = set(data['index_name'] for data in data_list)
    if len(index_names) > 1:
        raise ValueError("All embeddings in the batch must belong to the same index.")

    # Use the common index_name from the batch
    index_name = index_names.pop()

    # Send the entire batch to the bulk ingestion endpoint
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.post(f"http://database-service:8000/ingest/{index_name}", json=data_list)

        # If the ingestion is successful, clear the corresponding Redis keys
        if response.status_code == 200:
            ids_to_clear = [data['id'] for data in data_list]
            await delete_keys_from_redis(ids_to_clear)  # Clear Redis keys and remove from sets
            return response.status_code, response.json()
        else:
            raise Exception(f"Failed to ingest data: {response.text}")
```

### Professional Best Practices:
1. **Batch Operations**: Redis pipelines and batch operations (like `delete`, `srem`) ensure efficient use of resources and minimize network overhead.
2. **Cleanup of Tracking Sets**: Ensuring that tracking sets (`text_embedding_ids`, `image_embedding_ids`) are kept clean avoids inconsistent states where IDs remain in the sets despite their embeddings being removed.
3. **Minimal Redundancy**: By cleaning up Redis after successful ingestion, you minimize the risk of stale data accumulating, ensuring Redis remains efficient and lightweight.

### Conclusion:
- The **batch delete** ensures efficient cleanup of Redis keys after the embeddings have been ingested.
- Removing the IDs from **text and image embedding sets** keeps the tracking sets clean and avoids redundancy.
- This solution optimizes both **memory usage** and **performance**, while maintaining consistency in Redis, ensuring your data pipeline remains clean and efficient after processing.

This approach strikes the right balance between efficiency and maintaining data integrity, which is crucial in a production environment.
